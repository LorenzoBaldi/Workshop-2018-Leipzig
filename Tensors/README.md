## Future plans:
1. Constructions (flattening, Koszul flattenings, symmetrization, visualisation, other products,…)
2. Eigenvectors (characteristic polynomials,…)
3. Apolarity (symmetric, partially symmetric)
4. Ranks (exact computations, lower bounds, approximations, …)
5. Relations with Representation Theory (relation with SchurRings package?)
